 * COMP 249 Section PP, Winter 2023<p>
 * Assignment #1<p>
 * Due Date: February 3, 2023<p>
 * --------------------------------------------------------<p>
 *  Using different methods, this program begins by explaining the rules of the program and the game to
 *  the users, and continues by deciding the first player. Then, the program jumps right into the game with the first
 *  round, prompting each player to roll the dice, and displaying the players' positions on the game board which is
 *  printed after each player rolls the dice. This game also implements the rules of snakes and ladders, hence the name 
 *  of the game, meaning if a player lands on one of these special squares their position will change in correspondence 
 *  with their square's consequence. Finally, once a player reaches the 100th square, the game will end and the winner 
 *  will see their player number be congratulated on the console.<p>
 *  
 *  Note that a multiple player extension is easily accessible by altering the condition statement in the constructor and
 *  adding more player icons to be displayed on the board, as well as doing some minor tweaks on the first player decision 
 *  logic. Other than those three things, the program is essentially fully functional for more than 2 players.
